`summarize_ti_type/summarize_ti_plasmid.sh` is bash wrapper that use this script to mine plasmid types from a bunch of beav output folders. This assumes the *fna files, based on which beav sub-directories is generated, are in the same directory:

`./summarize_ti_plasmid.sh > plasmid_type.out`

## summarize_sketch.sh
